# Chengshilun (Satyasiddhiśāstra) Hanzi Quiz

## Description

This project offers a simple, web-based quiz, the aim of which is to assist users in the memorisation of essential Hanzi (Chinese characters) encountered in Harivarman's *Satyasiddhiśāstra* (成實論 - *Chengshilun*).

The quiz presently incorporates **280** Hanzi. It is understood that these represent in the region of 80% of the characters employed throughout the original text.

## Purpose

The principal aspiration behind this tool is to somewhat ease the process of memorising the more frequent Hanzi within the *Satyasiddhiśāstra*. It is sincerely hoped that by becoming rather more familiar with these characters, users might find their study of the text enhanced, and perhaps feel better equipped to appreciate the nuances of the original work or even contribute towards future translation efforts.

This endeavour seems potentially worthwhile, as existing English translations, whilst certainly valuable and possessing their own merits, perhaps do not always capture every subtlety of Harivarman's original discourse. This tool, therefore, humbly aims to provide a foundational step for those wishing to engage more deeply with the Chinese text.

## Usage

The quiz may be accessed directly online at your convenience:

The Hanzi are presented in a sequential manner, reflecting their presumed frequency or order derived from the textual analysis underpinning the list. For each Hanzi, a selection of possible meanings is offered. One simply chooses the option deemed correct in order to proceed.

## Contributing & Feedback

Feedback and suggestions for improvement would be most gratefully received. Translating classical terminology and ensuring accuracy is, of course, a considerable challenge, and I readily acknowledge that my own interpretations or the code itself may contain errors or areas ripe for refinement.

Therefore, should you happen to notice any potential inaccuracies – particularly concerning the nuances of the Hanzi meanings – or perhaps envision ways to enhance the quiz's code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I would be truly appreciative if you would kindly share your thoughts. Naturally, notification of any technical difficulties ('bugs') encountered would also be very helpful.
