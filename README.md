# Chengshilun (Satyasiddhiśāstra) Hanzi Quiz

## Description

This project is a simple web-based quiz designed to help users memorize essential Hanzi (Chinese characters) found in Harivarman's *Satyasiddhiśāstra* (成實論 - *Chengshilun*).

The quiz currently includes **316** unique Hanzi, which represent approximately 80% of the characters used throughout the entire text.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to facilitate the memorization of the most frequent Hanzi within the *Satyasiddhiśāstra*. By becoming familiar with these characters, users can hopefully enhance their study of the text and potentially contribute to a better understanding or even improved translations in the future.

This is particularly relevant as the currently available English translation, while having its merits, is often considered to have room for improvement. This tool aims to provide a foundational step for those wishing to engage more deeply with the original Chinese text.

## Usage

You can use the quiz directly online at:

The Hanzi are presented sequentially according to their frequency or order within the source text analysis used to generate the list. For each Hanzi, you are presented with multiple-choice options for its meaning. Choose the correct one to proceed.

## Contributing & Feedback

Suggestions for improvement are welcome! This includes:

* Refinements or corrections to the English meanings provided for the Hanzi.
* Improvements to the quiz code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
* Bug reports.
